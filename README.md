Technical Implementation

## Dataset Used:
The dataset includes:

Order details (date, day, month).
Product details (pizza name, category, size).
Sales metrics (quantity, revenue).
Data Preparation in Power BI:
Cleaned data using Power Query (removed duplicates, handled null values).
Created calculated columns for Month and Day from the order date.
Built measures using DAX for KPIs and trends.

# DAX Measures:
## Below are some key measures used:

Total Revenue = SUM(pizza_sales[total_price])
Avg Order Value = [Total Revenue]/[Total Orders]  
Avg Pizzas per Order = [Total Pizzas Sold]/[Total Orders] 
Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(pizza_sales[order_id])
Total Pizzas Sold = SUM(pizza_sales[quantity])
